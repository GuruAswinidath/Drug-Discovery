# Drug-Discovery

# Introduction
This project focuses on drug discovery using the Chembl database, a large-scale repository of bioactivity and drug-like properties for millions of compounds. Drug discovery is a crucial process in pharmaceutical research that involves identifying potential new drugs to treat various diseases.

# Dataset
The dataset used for drug discovery is directly obtained from the Chembl database. Chembl provides access to a wide range of bioactivity data, including binding affinity, inhibition constants, and other drug-like properties for a diverse set of compounds.

Please note that the usage of the Chembl database is subject to the terms and conditions specified on their website. Comply with their licensing terms before using the data for research or commercial purposes.
